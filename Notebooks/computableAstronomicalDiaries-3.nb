approximately opposite the moon, it has to be winter solstice. According to \
the scheme used for computing solstices (see above p. 26), the month has to \
be IX. From the same scheme it follows that the year has to be SE 10 plus or \
minus a multiple of 19 years. A choice can then be made among these years by \
using the observation in line 12' that the moon was below Mars on the 16th, \
and close to Jupiter on the 17th, both positions being in addition related to \

read k\[EBar]nu and to be understood as a translation of hoi ph\[IAcute]loi, \
is unlikely because UD is never used as a logogram for k\[EBar]nu, in spite \
of the fact that k\[EBar]nu is listed in A III/3:46 among possible readings \

this fits the context, it does not agree too well with the partly broken \
signs. Rev. 32': If \[CapitalSHacek]E before ITU BI really means \"month \
XII\", this is a very awkward way of expressing a month name. Since we are \
anyway dealing with month XII in this passage, there is no reason to repeat \
the month name. To explain this, one can assume that the historical remarks \

of an unknown month; the appearance ought to have occurred already on the 5th \
(obv. 12' and 16'); since this can only occur early in a year, the diary \
probably was for the first half of a year; b) some phenomenon of Sirius on \
the 23rd of the same month (obv. 10'); at this time of the year, this can \
only be last appearance; c) on the 18th of the same month, the moon was 1 2/3 \
cubits in front of Jupiter (obv. 7'); d) on the 20th of the same month, the \
moon was above \[Gamma] Capricorni (obv. 8'). By combining conditions (a) and \
(b) I arrive at SE 18 II and 208 II as possible dates between -450 and 0. The \
lunar data (c) and (d) exclude SE 208 and confirm SE 18. The date of the \
reverse is more problematic. If the remnants of rev. 12' are read correctly, \
Mars was in Cancer; this would mean month V or VI of the same year. Assuming \
month V, the position of the moon in rev. 8' refers to \[Delta] Cancri which \
makes possible the restoration proposed above. In agreement with this, the \
moon was next to Venus on the 26th day which is partly preserved in the \
following line. On the other hand, the first stationary point of Jupiter \

        "On rev. 6', an equinox is mentioned for the 7th. This must be the \
vernal equinox because Venus is said to have set in the beginning of Aries on \
the same day, implying that the sun is not very far from it. The equinox was \
not observed and therefore computed. No 7th day for a vernal equinox exists \
in the scheme that is used during the Seleucid period (see above p.    ); the \
text must be earlier. Combining the equinox and the last appearance of Venus \
in the beginning of Aries, the best fit during the 4th century B.C. is \
obtained in -375: last appearance of Venus on XII2 4, vernal equinox on XII2 \
9. This date is confirmed by the lunar position on the 2nd of this month. \
Note however that something is wrong with the lunar positions given for the \
following days: since the day number for both the 2nd and the 5th day are \
preserved, the two positions of the moon mentioned between them can only \
refer to the 3rd and the 4th. If the moon was 10 fingers in front of \[Eta] \
Tauri on the 2nd, it cannot be only 1 2/3 cubits in front of \[Alpha] Tauri \
on the next day because the distance in longitude between the two stars is \
only 10\[Degree]. A similar problem appears with the lunar positions in rev. \
7'ff.: the moon takes about two days to go from \[Eta] Leonis to \[Beta] \
Virginis; since the 11th lies in between, the moon must have been close to \
\[Alpha] Leonis on the 10th and to \[Eta] Virginis  on the 12th. This again \
does not go together with the lunar positions at the beginning of the month \
which would require the moon to be next to \[Alpha] Leonis already on the \

spelling e-du in the name of the normal star \[Gamma] Virginis is the final, \
if anticlimactic, link in a chain of arguments that led me to abandon the \
reading \[SHacek]ur-\[SHacek]i ABSIN that has been standard since Jensen\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s remark in G\[ODoubleDot]ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen 1902 \
371 (Kugler\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 1905 in SSB I 36 is wrong). First serious \
doubts came with the paleographical observation that the horizontal wedge of \
the alleged \[SHacek]ur is often written abnormally long. These misgivings \
were strengthened on considering the fact that the abbreviated writing of the \
star name appears as A\[CapitalSHacek], not \[CapitalSHacek]UR. The \
combination of these two pieces of evidence led me to the interpretation of \
the star name as DELE (i.e., \[EBar]du) \[SHacek]\[AAcute] IGI ABSIN. \
Decisive confirmation came in an unpublished astronomical diary for the year \
116 SE, BM 31804 (a text kindly called to my attention some years later by D. \
Kennedy), where the star name is spelled over two lines as A\[CapitalSHacek] \
and \[SHacek]\[AAcute] IGI ABSIN. The present text from Uruk, with its \
syllabic spelling e-du, only offers additional confirmation that \[SHacek]ur-\
\[SHacek]i ABSIN is a false reading. It now turns out that Landsberger MSL I \
158 n. 3 (later opposed by Thureau-Dangin TMB 36, n. 2 in support of Jensen) \
was right when he insisted on the interpretation i\[SHacek]id \[SHacek]ir\

Pisces at the beginning of the month, she can have moved into Aries only a \
little until the 9th, especially since she has to be in retrograde motion at \
the time of disappearance in the west. The sun would therefore be in Pisces \
on the 9th. This however is incompatible with a last appearance of Mercury in \
the east in Aries on the 16th of the same month. The contradiction can be \
resolved by assuming that in the statement about Venus last appearance in the \

sunset, so it must have occurred around noon. b) On the 20th of a month, the \
moon was in front of \[Beta] Capricorni; on a preceding day, the moon was 1 \
\.bd cubits behind Saturn (obv. 5'). It is certain that the observation with \
Saturn concerned the moon because the expression \"stood to the east/west\" \
is used only of the moon in relation to planets. It is also certain that the \
immediately preceding day, i.e. the 19th, is to be restored because there is \
only one Normal star between \[Theta] Ophiuchi (mentioned in obv. 4') and \
\[Gamma] Capricorni, viz. \[Beta] Capricorni, which is about 17 \.bd\[Degree] \
\"before\" \[Gamma] Capricorni; so the moon must have passed it somewhat more \
than a day earlier. Saturn is therefore to be sought not far from \[Beta] \
Capricorni. c) On the 17th of the same month, Venus, being morning star, was \
below \[Eta] Piscium (obv. 4'). The Mercury observation in obv. 2' agrees \
with the date thus found. The statement about Jupiter in rev. 3' does not \
fit, however; Jupiter was invisible during almost all of month VII. One could \
explain this as an error for Mercury which moved from Virgo into Libra in the \
course of this month. Note that a first appearance of a planet is observed in \

8\.b4. On the 28th of the preceding month, a rising or setting of Mercury in \
the east was omitted. These conditions together cannot be fulfilled in any \
year of the period in question. It it however likely that the decision about \
a Mercury phenomenon to have been omitted was made by the Babylonian \
astronomers by criteria different from our modern ones. If one extends the \
possible dates to those years in which a Mercury phenomenon occurred at the \
time indicated in the text, SE 216 III emerges as a solution. Some phenomenon \

night. 12: ma\[SHacek]\[SHacek]altu \[OpenCurlyQuote]sieve\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
is unlikely here. 13: The expression \:1e6dibih \:1e63upri, literally \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]slaughtering of a (finger)nail\[CloseCurlyQuote] is not \
attested elsewhere; I did not, however, find a different reading. It seems to \
be a weather phenomenon. SI here and in the following line may be part of a \
building; is it to be read qarnu, qannu \[OpenCurlyQuote]edge, fringe\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] ? 14: Since the beginning of the line is damaged, I do not \
know whether \[OpenCurlyQuote]servant of Marduk\[CloseCurlyQuote] refers to a \
person mentioned before. According to the writing conventions of these texts, \
L\[CapitalUAcute].TUR Marduk could also mean \[OpenCurlyQuote]son of Marduk\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]. - aburru seems to be part of a building here. - I take \
A.GURME\[CapitalSHacek] to be a plural of agurru \[OpenCurlyQuote]baked brick\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]. At the end of the line read probably ESIR.HI.A. 17: It is \
unlikely that Aspasin\[EBar] is to be restored at the beginning. The feminine \
form of \:1e6dar\[ABar]du which follows most likely refers to a water course \
whose name ended in -n\[EBar]. The verb \:1e6dar\[ABar]du here is probably \
the one meaning \[OpenCurlyQuote]to name, call\[CloseCurlyQuote], see G. \
McEwan, Iran 24 (1986) 92f. - Most of this line remains obscure. 18: Instead \

  "\"\<Below is an ancient Babylonian text containing astronomical \
observations. For each line in the text, identify the month and year that the \
line covers, and return the result in a JSON format.\n\n## Instructions\n1. \
**Determine the Year**\n\t- If a section starts with the year, use that year \
for all observations in that section, or until the months wrap around.\n\t- \
Years are always written as a dynasty followed by a number. For example 'SE \
30' or 'ArtII 26'.\n\t- If no year is explicitly stated, infer the year from \
the year guide.\n2. **Determine the Month**\n\t- The text is broken into \
sections shown with multiple line breaks.\n\t- For every in the text line, \
identify which month is discussed in that line.\n\t- Allowed months are I, \
II, III, IV, V, VI, VI2, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XII2. Only write months \
in the allowed format.\n\t- If a section starts with the month, use that \
month for all observations in that section.\n\t- If no month is explicitly \
stated, refer to the month guide to infer the order of months. The month \
guide will look something like '[I] II III [ ] VII-X ['.\n\t\t+ Each roman \
numeral in the month guide corresponds to a section of the text in order.\n\t\
\t+ Bracked roman numerals like '[I]' represent that a month was written, but \
it has been destroyed, and no longer appears in the surviving text.\n\t\t+ \
Empty brackets like '[ ]' mean that the intervening months are missing.\n\t\t\
+ Hyphenated guides like 'VII-X' mean that all the months from VII to X \
appear in order.\n\t- Every month is represented in the month guide. Only \
assign months to lines if those months are represented in the month guide.\n\t\
- If the month is ambiguous, or if the month guide says something like '...' \
or '[...]' for that section, write null in the month JSON field.\n3. \
**Missing or Ambiguous Data**\n\t- If the month is missing or ambiguous, \
write 'null' in the month JSON field. For example, `{'line':'o \
3','month':null,'year':'SE 30'}`\n4. **Edges**\n\t- Lines marked b.e. or l.e. \
represent writing on the bottom edge of the text. This is like the binding of \
the book, so it might contain information about what year(s) or month(s) the \
entire text covers.\n5. **Output Format**\n\t- Return the results in a JSON \
format WITH NO LINE BREAKS.\n\t- Return a JSON object of the form \
`{'results':[...]}` where the array contains an object for EVERY LINE in the \
input text, with the format like: `{'line':'o 3','month':'XI','year':'SE \
30'}`.\n\n## Example Input\nMonth Guide: [VIII] IX X XI [\nYear Guide: SE 33\n\

VI and XII. Since in our text the month is followed by two more months, it \
can only be month VI. The table further shows that the year is SE 6 + a \

following: a) first appearance of Mars in the beginning of Taurus on the 25th \
of an unknown month; the appearance ought to have occurred already on the 5th \
(obv. 12' and 16'); since this can only occur early in a year, the diary \
probably was for the first half of a year; b) some phenomenon of Sirius on \
the 23rd of the same month (obv. 10'); at this time of the year, this can \
only be last appearance; c) on the 18th of the same month, the moon was 1 2/3 \
cubits in front of Jupiter (obv. 7'); d) on the 20th of the same month, the \
moon was above \[Gamma] Capricorni (obv. 8'). By combining conditions (a) and \
(b) I arrive at SE 18 II and 208 II as possible dates between -450 and 0. The \
lunar data (c) and (d) exclude SE 208 and confirm SE 18. The date of the \
reverse is more problematic. If the remnants of rev. 12' are read correctly, \
Mars was in Cancer; this would mean month V or VI of the same year. Assuming \
month V, the position of the moon in rev. 8' refers to \[Delta] Cancri which \
makes possible the restoration proposed above. In agreement with this, the \
moon was next to Venus on the 26th day which is partly preserved in the \

Saturn around the middle of the month (rev. 4'); in the same month, Jupiter \

reached its second stationary point. Earlier in the year, there was an \
observable lunar eclipse (obv. 7'). During the month of this eclipse, a \

        "On rev. 6', an equinox is mentioned for the 7th. This must be the \
vernal equinox because Venus is said to have set in the beginning of Aries on \
the same day, implying that the sun is not very far from it. The equinox was \
not observed and therefore computed. No 7th day for a vernal equinox exists \
in the scheme that is used during the Seleucid period (see above p.    ); the \
text must be earlier. Combining the equinox and the last appearance of Venus \
in the beginning of Aries, the best fit during the 4th century B.C. is \
obtained in -375: last appearance of Venus on XII2 4, vernal equinox on XII2 \
9. This date is confirmed by the lunar position on the 2nd of this month. \
Note however that something is wrong with the lunar positions given for the \
following days: since the day number for both the 2nd and the 5th day are \
preserved, the two positions of the moon mentioned between them can only \
refer to the 3rd and the 4th. If the moon was 10 fingers in front of \[Eta] \
Tauri on the 2nd, it cannot be only 1 2/3 cubits in front of \[Alpha] Tauri \
on the next day because the distance in longitude between the two stars is \
only 10\[Degree]. A similar problem appears with the lunar positions in rev. \
7'ff.: the moon takes about two days to go from \[Eta] Leonis to \[Beta] \
Virginis; since the 11th lies in between, the moon must have been close to \
\[Alpha] Leonis on the 10th and to \[Eta] Virginis  on the 12th. This again \
does not go together with the lunar positions at the beginning of the month \
which would require the moon to be next to \[Alpha] Leonis already on the \

        "6\[CloseCurlyQuote] (from a letter of A. Sachs): The syllabic \
spelling e-du in the name of the normal star \[Gamma] Virginis is the final, \
if anticlimactic, link in a chain of arguments that led me to abandon the \
reading \[SHacek]ur-\[SHacek]i ABSIN that has been standard since Jensen\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s remark in G\[ODoubleDot]ttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen 1902 \
371 (Kugler\[CloseCurlyQuote]s 1905 in SSB I 36 is wrong). First serious \
doubts came with the paleographical observation that the horizontal wedge of \
the alleged \[SHacek]ur is often written abnormally long. These misgivings \
were strengthened on considering the fact that the abbreviated writing of the \
star name appears as A\[CapitalSHacek], not \[CapitalSHacek]UR. The \
combination of these two pieces of evidence led me to the interpretation of \
the star name as DELE (i.e., \[EBar]du) \[SHacek]\[AAcute] IGI ABSIN. \
Decisive confirmation came in an unpublished astronomical diary for the year \
116 SE, BM 31804 (a text kindly called to my attention some years later by D. \
Kennedy), where the star name is spelled over two lines as A\[CapitalSHacek] \
and \[SHacek]\[AAcute] IGI ABSIN. The present text from Uruk, with its \
syllabic spelling e-du, only offers additional confirmation that \[SHacek]ur-\
\[SHacek]i ABSIN is a false reading. It now turns out that Landsberger MSL I \
158 n. 3 (later opposed by Thureau-Dangin TMB 36, n. 2 in support of Jensen) \
was right when he insisted on the interpretation i\[SHacek]id \[SHacek]ir\

occurred on the 9th, Venus ought to have reappeared in the east within the \
same month because the interval between these two phenomena is never longer \
than 18 days (and even shorter at the time of the year implied by the planet\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s position in Aries). Furthermore, if Venus was still in \
Pisces at the beginning of the month, she can have moved into Aries only a \
little until the 9th, especially since she has to be in retrograde motion at \
the time of disappearance in the west. The sun would therefore be in Pisces \
on the 9th. This however is incompatible with a last appearance of Mercury in \
the east in Aries on the 16th of the same month. The contradiction can be \
resolved by assuming that in the statement about Venus last appearance in the \

moon was in front of \[Beta] Capricorni; on a preceding day, the moon was 1 \
\.bd cubits behind Saturn (obv. 5'). It is certain that the observation with \
Saturn concerned the moon because the expression \"stood to the east/west\" \
is used only of the moon in relation to planets. It is also certain that the \
immediately preceding day, i.e. the 19th, is to be restored because there is \
only one Normal star between \[Theta] Ophiuchi (mentioned in obv. 4') and \
\[Gamma] Capricorni, viz. \[Beta] Capricorni, which is about 17 \.bd\[Degree] \
\"before\" \[Gamma] Capricorni; so the moon must have passed it somewhat more \
than a day earlier. Saturn is therefore to be sought not far from \[Beta] \
Capricorni. c) On the 17th of the same month, Venus, being morning star, was \
below \[Eta] Piscium (obv. 4'). The Mercury observation in obv. 2' agrees \
with the date thus found. The statement about Jupiter in rev. 3' does not \
fit, however; Jupiter was invisible during almost all of month VII. One could \
explain this as an error for Mercury which moved from Virgo into Libra in the \
course of this month. Note that a first appearance of a planet is observed in \

or in the first half of the 1st likely. The lunar positions show the season \
to be spring; an exact lunar position is recorded for the first evening of a \
month which is not the first of the year, i.e., either II or III (l. 12\.b4). \
Based on this, a lunar position just before the 7th (l. 14\.b4) has to be \
above or below some other body because the other coordinate is expressed by \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]the moon having passed a little to the \
east\[CloseCurlyQuote]. No suitable star can be reconciled with the traces, \
but they do fit Jupiter. According to the order in which the planets are \
listed in planetary summaries, Mars is most likely to be restored in l. \
8\.b4. On the 28th of the preceding month, a rising or setting of Mercury in \
the east was omitted. These conditions together cannot be fulfilled in any \
year of the period in question. It it however likely that the decision about \
a Mercury phenomenon to have been omitted was made by the Babylonian \
astronomers by criteria different from our modern ones. If one extends the \
possible dates to those years in which a Mercury phenomenon occurred at the \
time indicated in the text, SE 216 III emerges as a solution. Some phenomenon \
on the 21st of the preceding month (l. 4\.b4) turns out to be a last \
appearance of Sirius. Confirmation comes from the price of wool (l. 8\.b4), \

observations. For each line in the text, identify the month and year that the \
line covers, and return the result in a JSON format.\n\n## Instructions\n1. \
**Determine the Year**\n\t- If a section starts with the year, use that year \
for all observations in that section, or until the months wrap around.\n\t- \
Years are always written as a dynasty followed by a number. For example 'SE \
30' or 'ArtII 26'.\n\t- If no year is explicitly stated, infer the year from \
the year guide.\n2. **Determine the Month**\n\t- The text is broken into \
sections shown with multiple line breaks.\n\t- A new section can also be \
indicated by going form the obverse to the reverse of the tablet, as \
indicated by the line number switching from something like 'o 10' to \
something like 'r 1'.\n\t- For every in the text line, identify which month \
is discussed in that line.\n\t- Allowed months are I, II, III, IV, V, VI, \
VI2, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, XII2. Only write months in the allowed \
format.\n\t- If a section starts with the month, use that month for all \
observations in that section.\n\t- If no month is explicitly stated, refer to \
the month guide to infer the order of months. The month guide will look \
something like '[I] II III [ ] VII-X ['.\n\t\t+ Each roman numeral in the \
month guide corresponds to a section of the text in order.\n\t\t+ Bracked \
roman numerals like '[I]' represent that a month was written, but it has been \
destroyed, and no longer appears in the surviving text.\n\t\t+ Empty brackets \
like '[ ]' mean that the intervening months are missing, or that there are \
sections in the text that could not be dated.\n\t\t+ Hyphenated guides like \
'VII-X' mean that all the months from VII to X appear in order.\n\t- Every \
month is represented in the month guide. Only assign months to lines if those \
months are represented in the month guide.\n\t- If the month is ambiguous, or \
if the month guide says something like '...' or '[...]' or '[ ]' for that \
section, write null in the month JSON field.\n3. **Missing or Ambiguous \
Data**\n\t- If the month is missing or ambiguous, write 'null' in the month \
JSON field. For example, `{'\\\"line\\\":\\\"o \
3\\\",\\\"month\\\":null,\\\"year\\\":\\\"SE 30\\\"}`\n4. **Edges**\n\t- \
Lines marked b.e. or l.e. represent writing on the bottom edge of the text. \
This is like the binding of the book, so it might contain information about \
what year(s) or month(s) the entire text covers.\n5. Write an out your \
reasoning and an explaination of how you assigned lines to months. Make it \
consise, but explain how you determined where the months breaks are, and how \
they relate to the month guide.\n6. **Output Format**\n\t- Return the results \
in a JSON format WITH NO LINE BREAKS.\n\t- Return a JSON object of the form \
`{'explaination':'...','results':[...]}` where the array contains an object \
for EVERY LINE in the input text, with the format like: `{\\\"line\\\":\\\"o \
3\\\",\\\"month\\\":\\\"XI\\\",\\\"year\\\":\\\"SE 30\\\"}`.\>\"", "&"}],

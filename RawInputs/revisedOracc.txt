Since the moon is in Leo on the 16th (line 12'), at which time of month the sun is approximately opposite the moon, it has to be winter solstice. According to the scheme used for computing solstices (see above p. 26), the month has to be IX. From the same scheme it follows that the year has to be SE 10 plus or minus a multiple of 19 years. A choice can then be made among these years by using the observation in line 12' that the moon was below Mars on the 16th, and close to Jupiter on the 17th, both positions being in addition related to Normal Stars. This eliminates all years except SE 48. The remaining lunar positions agree with this date, and so does the acronychal rising of Saturn mentioned for the 18th.",

Rev. 29': The sign after LUGAL looks like UD; since ERÍN \"troops\" would fit the context, UD is possibly an error for ERÍN. Admittedly, the king cannot have left all his troops behind at Sardes. The assumption of S.Smith, BHT p. 157, that UD is to be read kēnu and to be understood as a translation of hoi phíloi, is unlikely because UD is never used as a logogram for kēnu, in spite of the fact that kēnu is listed in A III\/3:46 among possible readings of UD. I have to admit that I do not know the meaning of UD.MEŠ here. For the interpretation of NUN SIG-ú see J. Renger, Or 54 257-259. The section from line 29' to the end was recently treated by R. J. van der Spek, Grondbezit in het Seleucidische Rijk (Amsterdam 1986), p. 211ff. Rev. 30': At the end of the line, S. Smith, followed by R. J. van der Spek, op. cit. p. 211, read ú-na-tu4. While this fits the context, it does not agree too well with the partly broken signs. Rev. 32': If ŠE before ITU BI really means \"month XII\", this is a very awkward way of expressing a month name. Since we are anyway dealing with month XII in this passage, there is no reason to repeat the month name. To explain this, one can assume that the historical remarks were excerpted from several diaries so that certain inconsistencies resulted. Upper edge 1: S.

From the table of solstices and equinoxes derived by O.Neugebauer from the scheme used in Seleucid times in JCS 2 216 it can be seen that an equinox on the 27th day occurs in months VI and XII. Since in our text the month is followed by two more months, it can only be month VI. The table further shows that the year is SE 6 + a multiple of 19. The date SE 25 provides an appropriate lunar eclipse and is confirmed by the other lunar data preserved.",

I base my dating on the following: a) first appearance of Mars in the beginning of Taurus on the 25th of an unknown month; the appearance ought to have occurred already on the 5th (obv. 12' and 16'); since this can only occur early in a year, the diary probably was for the first half of a year; b) some phenomenon of Sirius on the 23rd of the same month (obv. 10'); at this time of the year, this can only be last appearance; c) on the 18th of the same month, the moon was 1 2\/3 cubits in front of Jupiter (obv. 7'); d) on the 20th of the same month, the moon was above γ Capricorni (obv. 8'). By combining conditions (a) and (b) I arrive at SE 18 II and 208 II as possible dates between -450 and 0. The lunar data (c) and (d) exclude SE 208 and confirm SE 18. The date of the reverse is more problematic. If the remnants of rev. 12' are read correctly, Mars was in Cancer; this would mean month V or VI of the same year. Assuming month V, the position of the moon in rev. 8' refers to δ Cancri which makes possible the restoration proposed above. In agreement with this, the moon was next to Venus on the 26th day which is partly preserved in the following line. On the other hand, the first stationary point of Jupiter mentioned in rev. 7' has to be considered a mistake for second stationary point.",

This must be the vernal equinox because Venus is said to have set in the beginning of Aries on the same day, implying that the sun is not very far from it. The equinox was not observed and therefore computed. No 7th day for a vernal equinox exists in the scheme that is used during the Seleucid period (see above p.    ); the text must be earlier. Combining the equinox and the last appearance of Venus in the beginning of Aries, the best fit during the 4th century B.C. is obtained in -375: last appearance of Venus on XII2 4, vernal equinox on XII2 9. This date is confirmed by the lunar position on the 2nd of this month. Note however that something is wrong with the lunar positions given for the following days: since the day number for both the 2nd and the 5th day are preserved, the two positions of the moon mentioned between them can only refer to the 3rd and the 4th. If the moon was 10 fingers in front of η Tauri on the 2nd, it cannot be only 1 2\/3 cubits in front of α Tauri on the next day because the distance in longitude between the two stars is only 10°. A similar problem appears with the lunar positions in rev. 7'ff.: the moon takes about two days to go from η Leonis to β Virginis; since the 11th lies in between, the moon must have been close to α Leonis on the 10th and to η Virginis  on the 12th. This again does not go together with the lunar positions at the beginning of the month which would require the moon to be next to α Leonis already on the 9th.",

	"text_comments":"6’ (from a letter of A. Sachs): The syllabic spelling e-du in the name of the normal star γ Virginis is the final, if anticlimactic, link in a chain of arguments that led me to abandon the reading šur-ši ABSIN that has been standard since Jensen’s remark in Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen 1902 371 (Kugler’s 1905 in SSB I 36 is wrong). First serious doubts came with the paleographical observation that the horizontal wedge of the alleged šur is often written abnormally long. These misgivings were strengthened on considering the fact that the abbreviated writing of the star name appears as AŠ, not ŠUR. The combination of these two pieces of evidence led me to the interpretation of the star name as DELE (i.e., ēdu) šá IGI ABSIN. Decisive confirmation came in an unpublished astronomical diary for the year 116 SE, BM 31804 (a text kindly called to my attention some years later by D. Kennedy), where the star name is spelled over two lines as AŠ and šá IGI ABSIN. The present text from Uruk, with its syllabic spelling e-du, only offers additional confirmation that šur-ši ABSIN is a false reading. It now turns out that Landsberger MSL I 158 n. 3 (later opposed by Thureau-Dangin TMB 36, n. 2 in support of Jensen) was right when he insisted on the interpretation išid širʾi, not šuruš širʾi for the star name written as SUHUŠ AB-SÍN in 3 R 54:37a = ACh Sin 13:22.",

Weidner) because in rev. 16 it appears during the night as well as during daytime. It is rather another weather phenomenon, mentioned side by side with rain. 10: ALLA is used here not for the whole zodiacal constellation Cancer but only for Praesepe since Mars can pass through it within two days, as was remarked by P. V. Neugebauer and E. Weidner. 11: A translation “was balanced” for LÁL was proposed by A. Sachs. This expression seems to occur mostly (but not only) in those cases where both celestial bodies compared have the same longitude. It is restricted to the oldest diaries preserved so far. It probably went out of use because it was redundant: if no difference in longitude was mentioned one could conclude that there was none. - sin may be a mistake for the missing sign KUR “moonrise to sunrise”. 13: One is inclined to regard šer-tam DIB as an equivalent of ana NIM DIB, but this is rendered uncertain by the occurrence of the latter expression in line 14 and elsewhere; in addition, ana šerti is expected. 5’: The “elbow of Sagittarius” was identified as the cluster of stars around π Sagittarii by P.

However, if a last appearance of Venus in the west occurred on the 9th, Venus ought to have reappeared in the east within the same month because the interval between these two phenomena is never longer than 18 days (and even shorter at the time of the year implied by the planet’s position in Aries). Furthermore, if Venus was still in Pisces at the beginning of the month, she can have moved into Aries only a little until the 9th, especially since she has to be in retrograde motion at the time of disappearance in the west. The sun would therefore be in Pisces on the 9th. This however is incompatible with a last appearance of Mercury in the east in Aries on the 16th of the same month. The contradiction can be resolved by assuming that in the statement about Venus last appearance in the east was meant. Under this assumption, the date of the fragment would be SE 140, month I.

Between -400 and 0, the longitude of δ Capricorni fell between 290° and 295°. Therefore the conjunction of sun and moon at the end of this month must have occurred at a longitude greater than 300°. The text indicates that the month had 30 days. Conjunction must have occurred on the 29th. At the beginning of the following month, the longitude of the sun was therefore approximately between 314° and 338°. This second month can then have been only XI or XII. In the summary at the end of the first month, Jupiter is reported to be in Taurus; furthermore, between the 2nd and the 7th of the second month, \"the moon was 2 cubits behind η Tauri, 2 2\/3 cubits behind Jupiter to the east\" (rev. 4). Hence the longitude of Jupiter at the beginning of the second month was between 28° and 32°. If this is combined with the Mercury data of the 27th of the first month, the only possible date remaining is SE 69, months XI and XII. Once this date is found, the planet which began month XI in Libra according to the statement in rev. 1 turns out to be Mars, which moved from ca. 195° to 206° during month XI.",

It is certain that the observation with Saturn concerned the moon because the expression \"stood to the east\/west\" is used only of the moon in relation to planets. It is also certain that the immediately preceding day, i.e. the 19th, is to be restored because there is only one Normal star between θ Ophiuchi (mentioned in obv. 4') and γ Capricorni, viz. β Capricorni, which is about 17 ½° \"before\" γ Capricorni; so the moon must have passed it somewhat more than a day earlier. Saturn is therefore to be sought not far from β Capricorni. c) On the 17th of the same month, Venus, being morning star, was below η Piscium (obv. 4'). The Mercury observation in obv. 2' agrees with the date thus found. The statement about Jupiter in rev. 3' does not fit, however; Jupiter was invisible during almost all of month VII.

The lunar positions show the season to be spring; an exact lunar position is recorded for the first evening of a month which is not the first of the year, i.e., either II or III (l. 12´). Based on this, a lunar position just before the 7th (l. 14´) has to be above or below some other body because the other coordinate is expressed by ‘the moon having passed a little to the east’. No suitable star can be reconciled with the traces, but they do fit Jupiter. According to the order in which the planets are listed in planetary summaries, Mars is most likely to be restored in l. 8´. On the 28th of the preceding month, a rising or setting of Mercury in the east was omitted. These conditions together cannot be fulfilled in any year of the period in question. It it however likely that the decision about a Mercury phenomenon to have been omitted was made by the Babylonian astronomers by criteria different from our modern ones. If one extends the possible dates to those years in which a Mercury phenomenon occurred at the time indicated in the text, SE 216 III emerges as a solution. Some phenomenon on the 21st of the preceding month (l. 4´) turns out to be a last appearance of Sirius. Confirmation comes from the price of wool (l. 8´), which agrees with that in SE 216 I.",

It seems to be a weather phenomenon. SI here and in the following line may be part of a building; is it to be read qarnu, qannu ‘edge, fringe’ ? 14: Since the beginning of the line is damaged, I do not know whether ‘servant of Marduk’ refers to a person mentioned before. According to the writing conventions of these texts, LÚ.TUR Marduk could also mean ‘son of Marduk’. - aburru seems to be part of a building here. - I take A.GURMEŠ to be a plural of agurru ‘baked brick’. At the end of the line read probably ESIR.HI.A. 17: It is unlikely that Aspasinē is to be restored at the beginning. The feminine form of ṭarādu which follows most likely refers to a water course whose name ended in -nē. The verb ṭarādu here is probably the one meaning ‘to name, call’, see G.

I can only stress that whatever I write here about it is to be considered preliminary and uncertain. Because of this, I have used much restraint in translating. Improved understanding will require study of the original for an extended time. The section on month VII is paralleled by exemplars C and D. Right edge: There are a few lines on the right edge, in the right part closer to the obverse; some more before them may be lost in a break. Right edge: The lower edge is written in the opposite direction from obverse and reverse; it is likely that lower edge, left edge and upper edge, in this sequence, are to be read after the end of the reverse; due to the bad state of preservation, this cannot be proved.",

The writing KUR URI.KI.MEŠ occurs in No. -152 rev. 14´. 24: This person (called Theodosios ?) also occurs in exemplar A r. 4´. 31: The profession (if it is one) which I have transliterated RI+ZAG is unknown to me; the signs are probably to be read differently. It occurs several times in this text, and also in exemplar C 29´. Left edge 1: a possible translation ‘the strong god who hits your gods’ is unlikely because in l. 3 māhiṣu is not followed by a noun.

Some name ending in -kā may of course be Aršakā, i.e. Mithridates I; but munnû ‘appointed’ does not fit a king. 21´: Kugler read Ni-i-ka-a-(tur?) and took it to refer to Demetrius II who had assumed the title Nicator. As far as I know, Seleucid kings are never referred to by their titles in cuneiform texts; the traces of the last sign do not support Kugler´s reading; a certain Nikanor is mentioned in No. -140B r. 10, dated three months later. Upper edge 3: Instead of ina SIL.MEŠ ‘in the streets’, the signs could be read ina tar-ṣa? ‘opposite of’. 4: it is uncertain if this is the same Antiochus as mentioned above. One might guess that queen Laodike is his wife. Or does the text refer to an earlier Antiochos and his queen? 5: Kugler read Seleucia in this line, but the remaining traces do not support this.",
